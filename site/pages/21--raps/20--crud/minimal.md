# Easiest Possible CRUD

This is how we could start the app.
process of learning full stack.

We could learn the absolute basics here without as much confusing stuff.

## FIRST EXCLUDE THIS STUFF!

- database or any persistence
- permissions or even an idea of a user
- any REST stuff (just HTML)
- No local storage either

## Contents?

#### One table only, with:

  - Thymeleaf
  - Basic a9 - a14 like java package structures
  - all CRUD views for that one table

#### Possible extra to add value and make it easier

  - maybe some special routines for seeding data at startup

## Objectives for learning:

- basic debugging at testing at the smallest possible level
- browser dev-tools basics like network, console, source files
- make sure know which of systems (thymeleaf, html, server) is doing which thing
- reps reps reps

## Sequence:

- starter app like Trevor shows
