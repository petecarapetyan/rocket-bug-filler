# CRUD - Team Reps

CRUD is what most of us will be hired for, when we graduate.

In CRUD Team Reps we take what Trevor and the assignments teach us, and use these skills over and over on simple CRUD webapps until they become rote, even boring.

The bad news is that most of this stuff doesn't get easy or natural until you've done it the 10th time :(

The good news is that it DOES get a LOT faster to do, even on the second and third time. So those additional reps can go quickly, especially if you're doing it together as a team.

## A Sampling of Skills Reinforced

Even for stuff you already know, coding together as a team lets you learn different approaches - "Oh, I didn't know my IDE could be used like that!"

- Debugging a web app
- dev tools
- Chrome v Firefox
- Tricks for handling long chains of calls
- How to set expectations and budget your time
- Common go-tos for googling common situations
- Scripts
- cheats

## b4 We Start Each Session

We must always be speaking the same language
So we shall drill [this page](/reps/lingo/), first

## Documentation still to follow ...

We've been doing this for months now in the catchup group but pretty nearly without documentation of what we did. So this doc will need to catch up with same so that we can repeat our successes from that time.

## Menu of options

- working as a team on a CRUD app such as https://github.com/DanBerkness/Cars
- drilling mercilessly on the 4-5 tier model and which tier does which
- building and iterating on our own stats keeping app
- issues and tickets on assignment app 
- any other that works to advance full stack muscle memory
