## What will we do in the CRUD Reps sessions?

- plan, architect, and build a CRUD webapp (full stack)
- repeat again over and over with more complex CRUD
- split the work up, according to our current skills and needs

## Why the obsessive focus on lingo?

Every time a new guy shows up we all have to drop back and re-establish the lingo for what it is we are doing?

Isn't this a giant waste of time when we could be coding something instead?

If this drives you nuts, it should, but the remedy is to drop back and help the new guy acquire the language as quickly as possible. Why? _**Because we are doing this to get jobs!**_ And learning the lingo is how we get through the interview, get confident, and build our skills around our new language.

## Should I come if I cannot make it every time?

YES! Please come whenever you can.

The process itself is easier and smoother when the same people come every time, just because work organizes itself more around familiarity.

But every session is done when it is done, so if one person doesn't complete something the next guy to pick it up has to figure it out. This is how work happens in corporations sometimes, and it's a good skill to learn.

If you don't finish something and come back next time, don't count on it waiting for you. It might wait, or someone else might finish it their way, depending on what is convenient.

## What role will I play on the teams?

One thing you'll discover from working on a team, is that it's a lot easier to get your reps in when your in your groove. No matter what types of roles you normally assume within a group dynamic:

- Build a team
- Lead a team
- Join a team
- Support a team
- Fix bugs
- HTML or visual work
- Back end or database work

It's not important which role you play. What's important is that you find your approach and make it work for you. 

Negotiate the role you feel most comfortable with.

## Why Optional?

You made a contract to finish a set amount of work to graduate the bootcamp.

Since this extra work would - technically, at least - add extra to that workload, then it should be optional.

It is a possible paradox that repetition at the team level might reduce, rather than increase the cumulative effort required to hit your target of getting a job. Nonetheless, we can't contractually require that because it wouldn't be fair to change the contract after you already signed it.

## Do Team Reps have anything to do with Metrics?

You don't have to do either, or both. In that sense, they are not related. But they ARE complimentary.

Which is to say you can keep excellent metrics of all your work to wow your new employer, without attending a single Team Reps session. Or, the opposite.

But here's the rub, if you do both - even in an incomplete fashion - they reinforce each other.

And few things are more convincing to a prospective employer than reps in the area intended. "I did this thing once" is not as convincing as "I did this thing dozens of times"

## What if my Metrics are incomplete?

Dude! ALL Metrics are incomplete! Here's this story:

Trevor and I were talking one day about all the reps that a bootcamper graduates with, and how almost none are quantified. How many times did you do each of a loop, a variable assignment, a REST call or so many other things? 

If an employer knew these stats, how much better would he view your capabilities?

So the name of this game isn't perfection - you're going to do things here that weren't quantified. The name of this game is to approach a workable summary that would - at minimum - attempt to show you in the best light possible. If you don't get it all, don't sweat it. Good enough is good enough.

## Are Full Stack Web Apps the only way to do CRUD?

Corporations have lots of data, which means they need to do CRUD apps. 

It is more and more common to use Web Apps, or their close cousin Mobile Apps - as the Full Stack approach to doing CRUD.

But there are lots and lots of permutations on this, some having nothing to do with web apps, others offering only an API but no client, and still others offering machine specific apps for special use cases.

There is no right or wrong way to do CRUD, we just offer Web Apps in the Full Stack approach as the most common skill that is required by corporate employers.
