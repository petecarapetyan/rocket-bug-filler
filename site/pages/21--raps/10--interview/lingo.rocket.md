# What is Our Default Tues-Wed-Thurs Lingo?

To establish context all assignment levels 1-15 and these sessions, we need a shared language.

For every session we will need to re-establish the same default lingo. These reps reinforce the context where all of our work _"fits"_, within these sessions.

## 5 Basic Questions

- How does assignment 1 compare with a FANGTY Web App work:
  F facebook
  A amazon
  N netflix
  G google
  T twitter
  Y youtube
- Can someone who hasn't gone beyond assignment 1 fully participate in these sessions?
- What acronym do we use to describe our Web Apps?
- What are 2 challenges that FANGTY would have, that we will skip, at least at first.
- What full stack tier(s) can we drop out and still learn dynamic Web Apps?
