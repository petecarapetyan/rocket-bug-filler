# Spring Security - Additional Info

As is appropriate for a boot camp, Trevorâ€™s guidance through the spring security is a summary rather than an exhaustive course. 

One strategy for taking on Spring Security without going bonkers is to first write a hello world Spring Security app with Login and Registration etc. Then and only then, integrate it with a more complex project such as would be your final project.

With the above as a given, you can ask yourself - wouldn't someone have done that already? Like any good bootcamper, starting with google search is always the most expeditious approach.

That is how I found this - to keep me on the straight and narrow. First, the code itself:

And then, this is the youtube for same. Dan Berkness said he found it super helpful.
