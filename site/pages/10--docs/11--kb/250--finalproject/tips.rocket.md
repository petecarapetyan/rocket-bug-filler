# Tips for Your Final Project

Some of these are also featured on other pages but here are some notes.

- Know your why! Make sure you are doing this to make yourself look good to a prospective employer, not to just get finished with bootcamp!!!
- Study the [best of](best/) and copy ideas from others
- Cut features if it's features vs polish. At least, within reasonable bounds.
- Budget lots of time for thinking and planning.
- Start your planning process very early in the bootcamp, if you can.
- Get plenty of eyeballs on your work. Welcome constructive criticism from other bootcampers
- Spend some time thinking about your prospective employer. What would he or she wish to see in your final project?
- This doesn't have to be your final portfolio project. You can get it to a degree of completion, use it to graduate CodersCampus, then add to it later for a more complete portfolio project.
