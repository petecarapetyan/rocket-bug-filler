# After your bootcamp expires

Most bootcamp students sign up for 6 or 9 month terms, so what happens after that, if you haven't finished the work?

## Daily support ends

You might get a DM that looks like this, if you ask for a 1-1 after your term expires:

Hi [Herman]

Your 6 month Bootcamp support window ended [Aug 1st] so this gets a little bit complicated. Lots of good options, but it goes something like this.

If you want to continue on your own that is fine - we will still keep reviewing your assignments and (if you complete all your assignments) will help you find a job for a reasonable time depending on your specific contract, but the checkins and daily support are no longer in effect.

If you wish to resume receiving all the same support you had during the 6 month Bootcamp, you can do so by registering for extended support via a link which you would request from the instructor.

There are monthly fees associated with this extended support, but you are receiving a substantial discount because you already attended the 6 month Bootcamp.

If this is confusing or you wish to escalate to the top, DM Trevor and he will clarify.

And you would also be removed from the slack channels.

## When does assignment review and job help end?

This is where things get even more complicated...

As stated above, you can and should still finish on your own even if you don't get extended support.

1. You will still get your assignments reviewed as before.
2. You will still get help finding a job when you complete your assignments.

But, for how long will you get 1 and 2 above?

The answer to this question dependes on the contract you signed with us, and this contract is customized to each student.

But a good rule of thumb - and that is what we will probably go by - is 18 months after you start the bootcamp.
